| Classical Probability         | Based on the assumption that all outcomes in a sample space are equally likely. When to Use: Use when outcomes are equally likely. Formula: P(E) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes. Example: Flipping a fair coin, P(Heads) = 1/2. |
| Empirical (Experimental) Probability | Based on observations or experiments, calculated by dividing the number of times an event occurs by the total number of trials. When to Use: Use when data from experiments or observations is available. Formula: P(E) = Number of times event E occurs / Total number of trials. Example: Rolling a die 100 times, P(4) = 15/100 = 0.15. |
| Subjective Probability        | Based on personal judgment or belief about the likelihood of an event. When to Use: Use when you don’t have experimental or historical data but need an estimate based on knowledge or belief. Formula: No formula; based on personal judgment. Example: Weather forecaster saying there’s a 70% chance of rain tomorrow. |
| Conditional Probability       | The probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. When to Use: Use when you know that some condition has already occurred. Formula: P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). Example: P(King | Face card) = 4/12 = 1/3. |
| Joint Probability             | Refers to the probability of two events occurring together. When to Use: Use when interested in two events happening together. Formula: P(A ∩ B). Example: Probability of drawing a red face card from a deck: P(Red and Face card) = 6/52. |
| Marginal Probability          | The probability of an event occurring irrespective of other events. When to Use: Use when interested in the probability of one event occurring without regard to others. Formula: P(A) = Σ B P(A ∩ B). Example: P(Red) = 26/52 = 1/2 from a deck of cards. |
| Independent Probability       | Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the occurrence of the other. When to Use: Use when events do not influence each other. Formula: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B). Example: Flipping a coin and rolling a die. |
